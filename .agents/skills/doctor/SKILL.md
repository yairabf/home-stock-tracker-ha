# doctor - Blueprint health check

Where this sits in the workflow:

    any time  ->  [doctor]  ->  reads setup + plans + workflow state + git
                  (read-only)   prints health, warnings, and repair order

This skill answers one question: *is this Blueprint project ready to use?* It is
the diagnostic pass for setup drift, incomplete onboarding, missing files,
placeholder plans, stale generated context, Blueprint visibility, and confusing
workflow state. It never changes anything: no edits, no commits, no installs, no
builds, no branch changes.

Use `/status` when the user mainly wants progress and the next build action. Use
`/doctor` when the user wants to know whether the workflow itself is healthy.

## Input

None. `/doctor` takes no argument.

## What it checks

Gather these, then summarize. Do not dump file contents.

1. **Required Blueprint files**
   - Confirm `AGENTS.md`, `blueprint/`, `blueprint/project-plan.md`,
     `blueprint/build-plan.md`, and `blueprint/context/` exist.
   - Confirm `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`,
     `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`,
     `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`, and
     `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` exist.
   - Confirm `blueprint/history/features/` and `blueprint/history/fixes/` exist.
     When the rollback skill is installed, also check
     `blueprint/history/rollbacks/`. A missing rollback folder on a legacy
     installation is a warning, not a blocker; `/complete` creates it on the
     first rollback.
   - Check `blueprint/context/findings.md`. Missing on a legacy installation is
     a warning, not a blocker; `/audit` and `/complete` create it on first use.
     When present, confirm its entry headers still match
     `### <id> [<severity>] <status> - <title>` and warn on a malformed ledger.
     Report any P0 or P1 finding still `open` or `fixed` by ID, since it will
     block `/complete`. Never block on the ledger yourself.
   - Check `blueprint/context/review.md`. Missing on a legacy installation is a
     warning, not a blocker; `/audit independent current` and `/complete` create
     it on first use. When present, validate the required request or receipt
     fields and report pending, changes-requested, malformed, or stale state.
   - If `.gitignore` marks Blueprint workflow files as local-only, still require
     the files to exist on disk. Ignored but present is healthy; ignored and
     missing means the local workflow needs to be restored.
   - Read `blueprint/config.json` when present. Missing is healthy and means
     built-in defaults. When present, require a regular non-symbolic-link JSON
     file with `schemaVersion: 1`. Reject unknown keys and unsupported values.
     Report the effective workflow, git, verification, regular quality-gate,
     Continuous quality-gate, and Continuous Mode settings. Confirm each audit,
     independent-review, check, and try-guide gate uses its supported values and
     defaults to `manual`.
     An invalid config is a setup blocker for mutating workflow skills because
     they must not guess which policy to follow.
2. **Tool adapters**
   - Read `blueprint/.state/manifest.json` when present and report its exact
     logical adapters: Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode.
   - Confirm at least one compatible skill tree exists. Codex and GitHub Copilot
     use `.agents/skills/`. Claude Code uses `.claude/skills/`. OpenCode can use
     either tree.
   - If both skill trees are present, say that is healthy when the selected
     tools require both. Compare their skill folder names and warn about missing
     skills on either side.
   - If OpenCode is selected, do not require `.opencode/skills/`. If it contains
     duplicate Blueprint skills alongside `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`,
     warn that OpenCode discovers all of those locations and the duplicate tree
     should be reviewed.
   - If git shows changes under `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`, check
     the matching adapter file too. Warn when workflow behavior was updated in
     one adapter but not the other.
   - If only one tool is used, mention the unused adapter can be deleted. Do not
     treat extra adapters as an error.
   - If `CLAUDE.md` exists and still starts with `# Project Name`, flag that
     `/onboard` probably has not finished.
   - When Claude Code is installed, report its startup-context shape. Confirm
     `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`, `project-overview.md`, and
     `current-feature.md`. If it directly imports `coding-standards.md` or
     `ai-interaction.md`, warn that this is the legacy higher-context layout and
     give the exact two import lines to remove. Count the imported files and
     their total byte size, plus the total byte size of project skill
     descriptions. Label these as file-size diagnostics, not token counts.
     Recommend Claude Code's `/context all` for the live token breakdown.
3. **Commands and project setup**
   - Check whether root `README.md` is still the copied Blueprint workflow doc
     by looking for `# AI Coding Blueprint` or opening text that describes the
     Blueprint workflow instead of the app. If so, warn that `/onboard` should
     replace it with a project README before publishing.
   - If `blueprint/README.md` clearly contains copied Blueprint workflow docs,
     report it as an obsolete installer artifact. Its absence is healthy. An
     unchanged managed copy can be removed by the updater; a modified copy needs
     user review.
   - Check whether `AGENTS.md` has a `## Commands` section with dev and build
     commands.
   - Report missing lint or test commands as informational unless the project has
     real lint or test scripts elsewhere that are not reflected in `AGENTS.md`.
   - If `package.json` exists, compare its scripts against `AGENTS.md` at a high
     level. Do not require every script to be documented.
   - If `AGENTS.md` declares a `Verify` command, confirm it resolves to real
     project commands in the expected order: typecheck, tests when configured,
     then build. Do not require checks the project does not have.
   - If `.github/workflows/verify.yml` exists, confirm it runs the exact documented
     `Verify` command for pull requests and pushes to the default branch, uses the
     detected runtime and package manager, and starts with read-only contents
     permission. Preserve other workflows and report overlap for review.
   - A missing `Verify` command or GitHub workflow is informational. It means the
     optional automatic-check setup was not selected, not that the Blueprint is
     unhealthy.
4. **Ignore rules**
   - Check obvious ignore patterns for the detected stack. For Node or Astro,
     look for `node_modules`, `.env`, `dist`, and framework cache folders such as
     `.astro` or `.next` when relevant.
   - Detect local-only Blueprint mode if `.gitignore` ignores `.agents/`,
     `.claude/`, `blueprint/`, or `CLAUDE.md`. Report it as a visibility choice,
     not a failure, when the local files exist.
   - In local-only mode, check whether tracked `AGENTS.md` still describes the
     Blueprint workflow, lists hidden adapter paths, or exposes the core skill
     list. If so, warn that `/onboard` should make `AGENTS.md` public-safe.
   - If local-only mode is active but those paths are already tracked by git,
     warn that `.gitignore` does not hide tracked files and the user must approve
     any `git rm --cached` cleanup separately.
   - Keep this conservative. If uncertain, report "review" instead of failure.
5. **Planning readiness**
   - Check whether `blueprint/project-plan.md` and `blueprint/build-plan.md` look
     filled in or still template-like. Treat obvious TODO, TBD, example-only text,
     or empty required sections as not ready.
   - Check whether `blueprint/build-plan.md` is a numbered checkbox list. Raw
     bullets are allowed as a first draft, but they should be normalized by
     `/overview` before the build loop starts.
   - Count checked and unchecked leaf items in `blueprint/build-plan.md`.
6. **Overview freshness**
   - Check whether `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` exists and looks
     generated from the current plans.
   - Report its byte size. At or above 20,000 bytes, call it oversized and say
     `/feature` should stop until `/overview` regenerates a compact
     consolidation.
   - If either planning file appears newer than the overview by filesystem time,
     call the overview possibly stale and suggest `/overview` before feature work.
7. **Current workflow state**
   - Check whether `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` is the reset stub or an
     active feature, fix, or rollback spec.
   - If a spec is active, report checked and unchecked implementation steps.
   - If `current-feature.md` is the reset stub but git has source or workflow
     changes, warn that work is happening without an active spec.
   - Flag active spec on `main`, all spec steps checked but no completion, or a
     branch that does not match the configured feature, fix, or rollback prefix
     for the spec type. For a feature, also flag a mismatch with the next
     unchecked build-plan item. For a rollback, confirm its target is a checked item and do
     not compare it to the next unchecked item.
8. **Git**
   - Report current branch, clean vs dirty working tree, rough changed-file count,
     last commit subject, and whether the branch is ahead of upstream.
   - If the directory is not a git repo, report that as a setup issue and keep
     going.

## Output

Print a compact health report with these labels:

    Health: Pass | Needs attention | Blocked
    Setup: ...
    Configuration: ...
    Verification: ...
    Adapters: ...
    Context: ...
    Visibility: ...
    Plans: ...
    Workflow: ...
    Git: ...
    Watch: ...
    Repair order: ...

Use `Watch:` only when there are warnings. Use `Repair order:` for the exact next
steps, in order. Keep it short and practical.

Choose the repair order in this priority:

- Required Blueprint files missing -> overlay the Blueprint again, or use
  `/adopt` for a brownfield app.
- Invalid `blueprint/config.json` -> fix the named key or value, then rerun
  `/doctor`. Do not mutate project work while configuration is ambiguous.
- No git repo -> initialize git before using the build loop.
- No tool adapter -> restore `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` for the
  selected tool. OpenCode can use either compatible tree.
- Claude uses the legacy direct context imports -> remove the exact
  `@blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` and
  `@blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` lines from `CLAUDE.md`, then rerun
  `/doctor`. The files stay in the project and workflow skills still read them.
- Onboarding incomplete -> run `/onboard`.
- Root README is still the Blueprint workflow doc -> run `/onboard` to replace
  it with a project README before publishing.
- Local-only visibility selected but ignored Blueprint files are missing ->
  reinstall or restore the Blueprint files locally.
- Local-only visibility selected but Blueprint paths are tracked -> ask whether
  to untrack them with `git rm --cached` while keeping local files.
- Local-only visibility selected but `AGENTS.md` still exposes the workflow ->
  run `/onboard` to make `AGENTS.md` a lightweight public project guide.
- A documented `Verify` command, project script, and GitHub workflow disagree ->
  run `/ci` to review and align them. Missing optional CI alone does not need
  repair.
- Commands or ignore rules need review -> update the files or run `/onboard` if
  this is an early project.
- Plans are placeholders -> fill `blueprint/project-plan.md` and
  `blueprint/build-plan.md`.
- Overview missing or stale -> run `/overview`.
- Active spec has unchecked steps -> run `/status` or `/implement`, depending on
  whether the user wants orientation or action.
- A P0 or P1 finding is `open` -> repair it through `/implement` while a spec
  is active, or `/fix <finding id>` between work items. One that is `fixed` ->
  `/audit` to re-review and close it. Both come before suggesting `/complete`.
- Active spec is done but not closed -> run `/check`, then `/complete`.
- Everything is healthy -> say so, then suggest `/status` for progress or
  `/feature` for the next planned feature.

## Rules

- **Read-only, always.** This skill never writes files, never commits, never runs
  installs, never runs builds or tests, and never switches branches.
- **Diagnose, then order repairs.** Do not just list problems. End with the
  smallest ordered sequence that gets the project back to a healthy state.
- **Do not over-police adapters.** Extra adapters are optional clutter, not a
  failure.
- **Be conservative with stack-specific checks.** If a command or ignore pattern
  is uncertain, mark it for review instead of inventing a hard failure.
- **Stay concise.** A doctor pass should feel like a checklist, not an audit.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with lists for
enumerations and tables for matrices rather than dense paragraphs.
