# try - manual review guide

Where this sits in the workflow:

    /implement or /complete  ->  [try]  ->  human review
    (work exists)                (manual   (where to go,
                                  path)     what to click)

`/check` proves behavior from the agent side. `/try` gives the user a practical
manual walkthrough: start this command, open this route, click these controls,
expect this result, and watch for these failure signs.

It is always read-only. It does not edit files, install dependencies, commit,
merge, push, or run destructive commands.

The quality-gate config controls when another workflow generates this guide
automatically. An explicit `/try` or `$try` request always runs. A generated guide
never counts as evidence that the user performed the walkthrough.

## Input

Optional scope:

- no argument: use the active feature, fix, or rollback in
  `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`
- `latest`: use the most recent archive under `blueprint/history/features/`,
  `blueprint/history/fixes/`, or `blueprint/history/rollbacks/`
- a step name or number: focus the guide on that current-feature step
- a path, route, or command: include it as the main thing to try

If there is no active feature and no useful archive, ask what change the user
wants to try instead of guessing.

## Step 1 - find the work to explain

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `blueprint/config.json`
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`
- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`
- `blueprint/build-plan.md`
- latest files under `blueprint/history/features/`,
  `blueprint/history/fixes/`, and `blueprint/history/rollbacks/`, if the current
  feature is reset
- git branch and working tree status

Prefer the active spec. If `current-feature.md` is the reset stub, use the most
recent archived feature, fix, or rollback by filename or modification time and
say that is what you used.

Do not dump the spec. Pull out the routes, commands, UI surfaces, CLI commands,
API endpoints, data states, and done-whens that matter for a human trying it.
For a rollback, lead with the path that proves the removed behavior is gone, then
include one unaffected regression path from the rollback spec.

## Step 2 - identify how to run the app

Use the Commands section in `AGENTS.md`. Match the project type:

- **Web app** - dev server command, URL, and the route or screen to open.
- **Server/API** - server command, base URL, endpoint, method, and expected
  response shape.
- **CLI** - exact command(s), arguments, and expected output.
- **Library** - example command, test fixture, REPL snippet, or sample call.
- **Hybrid app** - list the smallest set of commands needed, such as backend plus
  web dev server.

If the app may already be running, say how to reuse it. If a command is missing
from `AGENTS.md`, report that as a gap rather than inventing certainty.

## Step 3 - write the manual guide

Produce a short guide with these sections:

1. **Start** - commands to run and where to run them.
2. **Open** - URLs, screens, tabs, API endpoints, or CLI commands.
3. **Do** - clicks, inputs, selections, or command arguments.
4. **Expect** - visible result, output, response, state change, file, or lack of
   error.
5. **Watch For** - common wrong outcomes, console or network errors, stale data,
   missing fields, bad empty states, layout issues, or safety warnings.

Keep it concrete. Prefer:

    Open http://127.0.0.1:7788/api/snapshot
    Expect a JSON object with `generated_at`, `services`, `projects`, and
    `conflicts`.

Avoid:

    Check that the snapshot works.

## Step 4 - include confidence and gaps

End with:

- **Best signal** - the one thing the user should try first.
- **Optional deeper checks** - only if useful.
- **Gaps** - anything the guide cannot know from the docs, such as missing route
  names, seed data, credentials, or external services.

If the feature is not user-visible, say so and provide the closest manual signal,
such as an API response, CLI output, log line, or unit test command.

## Rules

- Read-only only. Do not edit, commit, merge, push, install, or delete.
- Do not run the app unless the user explicitly asks you to try it for them.
- Do not pretend a path is known when the spec does not say it. Give the best
  likely path and label uncertainty.
- Keep the guide short enough to follow while the app is open.
- Match the project's commands from `AGENTS.md`.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with numbered
steps for the manual path and short bullets for warnings.
