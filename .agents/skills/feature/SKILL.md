# feature - turn a build-plan feature into a buildable spec

**First action:** Before project inspection, preflight, or any other tool call,
publish `running` to `blueprint/.state/run.json` using the dashboard activity
contract in `AGENTS.md`.

Where this sits in the workflow:

    project-overview.md  +  build-plan.md  ->  [this skill]  ->  build
    (source of truth,        (which feature       (the spec for      (code,
     from /overview)          to build)            one feature)        reviewed)

`build-plan.md` is intentionally high-level - one line per feature, no detail,
no ordering ceremony. All of that is this skill's job: take one listed feature,
read the full context from `project-overview.md`, and turn it into something
buildable.

## Input

A feature from `build-plan.md`, by number or name - e.g. `/feature 3` or
`/feature "typing engine"`.

The request may also describe a genuinely new feature that is not in the build
plan yet. That goes through the new-feature intake in Step 1. Never silently add
scope to the user-owned plans.

**With no argument, build the next one.** `/feature` on its own specs the first
unchecked item in `build-plan.md`. The build plan is a checklist; finished
features are checked off, so the first unchecked item is always what's next. (If a
big item has been split into sub-items, the next unchecked sub-item is the target.)

## Step 1 - pick the target

- Given a number or name that matches a build-plan item -> use it.
- Given a request that clearly describes a new feature with no reasonable match
  in the build plan -> follow **New-feature intake** below.
- No argument -> read `build-plan.md` top to bottom and take the first unchecked
  leaf (a plain item, or a sub-item under one that was split).

### New-feature intake

Use this path for a new product capability, not a bug or small unplanned change.
Those still belong in `/fix`.

1. Search checked and unchecked items for an existing or near-duplicate feature.
   If the wording may simply be a mistaken name, show the closest matches instead
   of creating new scope.
2. If it is genuinely new, propose one feature-sized checkbox line and where it
   belongs in `build-plan.md`. Preserve completed items and their numbering. Use
   the next unused whole number for a new top-level item. If the existing plan is
   complete, place it under an existing later milestone heading or propose a
   `## Post-MVP` heading.
3. Check whether the feature materially changes the product direction, users,
   data, stack, monetization, UI/UX, or deployment. Include exact proposed edits
   to the relevant `project-plan.md` sections only when needed. An incremental
   feature normally changes only `build-plan.md`.
4. Stop for approval before editing either user-owned plan. Show the complete
   proposed plan change, including any project-plan edits, in the review request.
5. After approval, write the plan changes, follow the installed `overview` skill
   to regenerate `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`, then resume this skill
   with the newly added build-plan item as the target. If overview finds a
   contradiction or decision the user must resolve, stop there and do not spec
   against unresolved context.

The result follows the same normal loop as any other planned feature. Do not
create a second build plan or bypass overview regeneration.

**If the build plan isn't a checklist yet** - a plain list with no `- [ ]` boxes -
treat every item as unchecked: take the first item as the target, and offer to
convert the list to a checklist so progress is trackable from here on. Proceed
with the first item whether or not the user wants the conversion.

State which feature you're building before going further.

## Step 2 - size it, and split if too big

Read the target line from `build-plan.md`, then check the byte size of
`blueprint/context/project-overview.md` before reading it. At or above 20,000
bytes, stop and tell the user to run `/overview` to regenerate a compact
consolidation. Do not pull the oversized file into the conversation again. If
the overview is already present in project instructions or the current session,
use that copy and do not read it again with a tool. Otherwise, read it once for
the data model, stack, and conventions. Decide how big the feature is:

- **Small enough to build and review as one unit** -> one spec. Continue to
  Step 3.
- **Too big for one reviewable spec** -> split it. Propose a short list of
  sub-features in chat (title + one line each), let the user adjust it, then write
  those sub-items back under the parent in `build-plan.md` as an indented
  checklist (`4a`, `4b`, `4c` ...). Spec only the **first** sub-feature now; the
  rest get picked up on later `/feature` runs.

Two levels of breakdown - don't confuse them:

- **Sub-features** (here) - each is big enough to stand alone: its own branch,
  spec, review-and-merge cycle, and archive entry.
- **Build steps** (in the spec, Step 3) - small diffs *within* one feature.

Worked example - "Authentication" is too big for one spec, so it splits into
sub-features in `build-plan.md`:

    - [ ] 4. Authentication
      - [ ] 4a. Registration - sign-up page + create Profile and handle
      - [ ] 4b. Login - sign-in page + session
      - [ ] 4c. Route protection - gate saving/drills/leaderboard, plus sign-out

Then *within* 4a, the build steps are small: first "registration page UI", then
"register server action + validation + redirect". The page and its logic are
steps, not separate features.

This sizing call is the skill's job, not the build plan's - that's exactly why the
build plan starts high-level.

## Step 3 - write the spec

For the one (sub-)feature being built now, write a full spec to
`blueprint/context/current-feature.md` (create `blueprint/context/` if needed), following
`reference/feature-spec-template.md`. Fill every section: goal, in/out of scope,
the build loop, small build steps as a checklist (`- [ ]`, each with an observable
"done when" - `/implement` ticks them off and resumes from the first unchecked
one), files/areas, data/contracts, testing, and notes for the AI.

Read the Commands section of `AGENTS.md` while defining testing. When it declares
`Browser tests: <command>`, include focused browser-test coverage for stable
behavioral done-whens when that coverage is proportionate. Keep visual fidelity,
real authenticated-profile behavior, browser chrome, and other harness gaps in
the direct Check or Try path instead of pretending automation covers them.

**Visual or replication features need a reference image.** If the feature is
"make it look like X" - recreating an existing design, matching a mockup, or
rebuilding a Canva/Figma artifact - prose underspecifies the target and the build
will approximate it wrong. Ask the user for a screenshot or image if one isn't
already provided, save it under `blueprint/reference/` (create the folder if
needed), and link it from the spec's Design reference section. Don't write a
visual spec from words alone when an image could exist.

**If `prototypes/` exists, that is your design reference.** When `/prototype` has
run, the repo holds `prototypes/theme.css` (the locked design tokens) and
`prototypes/*.html` (the visual mockups). For a UI-facing feature, link the
relevant mockups from the spec's Design reference section instead of asking for a
screenshot - they beat a flat image, since they carry the exact tokens. Treat
`theme.css` as the source of truth for colors, type, and spacing, and make the
feature's **first build step** port those tokens into the app's global stylesheet
(`@theme` for Tailwind v4, or the project's equivalent) before building components
against the mockups. The mockups are throwaway: once the look is built they get
discarded at `/complete`.

This is a draft. Don't present it yet - critique it first.

## Step 4 - red-team the draft, then tighten

Before the user reads it, turn on the spec yourself and try to break it. The
cheapest place to catch a scope problem or an oversized step is here, before any
code exists. Run the draft against these questions:

- **Coverage.** What does this feature need that no step delivers? Push on the
  unhappy paths the happy-path spec skipped: empty / missing / malformed input,
  the error / loading / empty states, the first-run case, failure of anything
  external it calls.
- **Visual fidelity.** If this is a look-alike or replication feature, is a
  reference image linked in the spec - or are we about to build a design blind
  from prose? If `prototypes/` exists, are the relevant mockups linked as the
  Design reference and is porting `theme.css` into the app the first build step?
  If a real design exists and nothing is captured, get it before building, not
  after the approximation lands.
- **Step size.** Would any step's diff be too big to read in one sitting? If so,
  split it - oversized steps defeat the review gate.
- **Order.** Does each step leave the app working, and depend only on earlier
  steps, never a later one? Resequence if not.
- **Contracts.** Is any type, route, or stored shape that a later feature will
  touch left undefined here? Lock it now and flag it load-bearing.
- **Scope honesty.** Is anything creeping in that belongs to a later feature? Is
  anything pushed to "out of scope" that this feature actually can't ship without?
- **Done-whens.** Is each one observable and checkable by `/check`, or is it a
  vague "it works"? Make it concrete.
- **Testing.** Does the predicted coverage match the gate - in-scope logic gets a
  test when a `test` command is declared in `AGENTS.md`; stable browser behavior
  gets focused coverage when a `Browser tests` command is declared; remaining UI
  and integration claims ride on direct browser evidence plus build?

Apply the fixes to `current-feature.md`. Then stop and present the spec, leading
with a short **"what the critique changed"** note - the splits, gaps, or scope
cuts you made (or "nothing - the draft held up"). That note is the point: it shows
the gate working before a line of code is written.

Tell the user to review and adjust. This skill plans; it never starts building.

## Rules the spec must follow

- **Small, reviewable steps.** Each step ends with something working and a diff
  small enough to read in full. If a step's diff would be too big to review, the
  step is too big - split it. This review gate is the point.
- **Build in order.** Sequence the steps so each builds on the last and leaves
  the app working.
- **Lock data contracts early.** If a shape (type, API response, stored field) is
  used by a later feature, define it now and flag it as load-bearing.
- **Flag client vs server** and any conventions from `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md`
  (for example, filtering user-scoped queries by the authenticated user's id).
- **Scope honestly.** State what is deferred so the feature stays contained.

## When a (sub-)feature is done

Check its box in `build-plan.md` (and the parent item once all its sub-items are
checked), archive the finished `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` to
`blueprint/history/features/NN-name.md`, then run `/feature` again for the next one.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with lists for
enumerations and tables for matrices rather than dense paragraphs.
